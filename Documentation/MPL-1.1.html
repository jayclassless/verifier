		<a id="section3.1" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.1. Application of License.</span><br />
		The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, 
		including without limitation <a href="#2.2">Section 2.2</a>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
		be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
		<a href="#6.1">Section 6.1</a>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
		Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
		restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
		include an additional document offering the additional rights described in <a href="#3.5">Section 3.5</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.2" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</span><br />
		Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
		under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
		Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
		made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
		months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
		version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible
		for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
		is maintained by a third party.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.3" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.3. Description of Modifications.</span><br />
		You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
		made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
		the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
		and including the name of the Initial Developer in:
		<ul>
			<li><a id="section3.3.a" /><span class="subSectionTitle">(a)</span> the Source Code, and</li>
			<li><a id="section3.3.b" /><span class="subSectionTitle">(b)</span> in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.4" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</span>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a id="section3.4.a" />
				<span class="subSectionTitle">(a) Third Party Claims.</span><br />
				If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
				rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under
				Sections <a href="#2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a
				text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim
				and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
				contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available
				as described in <a href="#3.2">Section 3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the
				LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
				steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
				to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a id="section3.4.b" />
				<span class="subSectionTitle">(b) Contributor APIs.</span><br />
				If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
				Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
				that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a id="section3.4.c" />
				<span class="subSectionTitle">(c)Representations.</span><br />
				Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to <a href="#3.4.a">Section 3.4(a)</a>
				above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
				creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
				this License.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.5" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.5. Required Notices.</span><br />
		You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#exhibitA">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the Source Code. If
		it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
		must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
		look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
		Contributor to the notice described in <a href="#exhibitA">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this
		License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
		rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
		only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make
		it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
		You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
		liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability terms You offer.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.6" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</span><br />
		You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>
		- <a href="#3.5">3.5</a> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
		the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
		description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of <a href="#3.2">Section 3.2</a>. The
		notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
		collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
		Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
		terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
		that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
		the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
		version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
		License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
		indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
		or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a id="section3.7" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">3.7. Larger Works.</span><br />
		You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
		License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
		requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectionTitle"><a id="section4" />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
		Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:

			<li><a id="section4.b" /><span class="subSectionTitle">(b)</span> describe the limitations and the code they affect.</li>
		</ul>
		Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in <a href="#3.4">Section 3.4</a> and must be
		included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
		such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

</ul>

<div class="sectionTitle"><a id="section5" />5. Application of this License.</div>
<ul>

		This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in <a href="#exhibitA">Exhibit A</a>

		<span class="subSectionTitle">6.2. Effect of New Versions.</span><br />

<div class="sectionTitle"><a id="section7" />7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</div>
<ul>

		<span class="subSectionTitle">8.1.</span>
		This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms

	<li>
		<a id="section8.2" />
		<span class="subSectionTitle">8.2.</span>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<a id="section8.2.a" />
				<span class="subSectionTitle">(a)</span>

		<span class="subSectionTitle">8.4.</span>
		In the event of termination under Sections <a href="#8.1">8.1</a> or <a href="#8.2">8.2</a> above, all end user
