        ! Information About Release


Version 0.3 (xx/xx/2004)
-----------------------
   [+] NAnt build script added to project.
   [*] Opening MD5 filelists now has more success. It does not base its identification on file extensions anymore. It will try the more popular format first, and if it doesn't find anything, it will try the other format. (Bug #1022000)
   [+] You can now open filelists with any file extension, and Verifier will ask you what kind of file it is.
   [+] A warning is shown if Verifier could not find any entries in the file list.
   [+] An Options screen is now available (Tools->Options).
   [*] Class for managing application settings replaced by a piece of AMS.Profile (http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/ReadWriteXmlIni.asp).
   [+] File associations can be set and unset in the Options. (Thanks to http://www.mentalis.org/soft/class.qpx?id=5)


Version 0.2 (7/5/2004)
-----------------------
   [+] Filelists loaded on startup are now optionally processed automatically.
   [+] Application now uses the .config file for storing settings.
   [+] Processing thread priority is now configurable.
   [X] Fix a bug where sometimes the FileListProcessor would report more than 100% complete, which caused crashes.
   [+] Dragging a file list onto the application will now open it.
   [+] List processing can now be stopped before completion.
   [+] Application now optionally confirms upon exit when list processing is going on.
   [*] FileList reading is now separated into separate classes.
   [+] Added a file icon to mark which file is currently being processed.
   [+] Application can now optionally remember its window settings (location, size, etc).
   [X] Fixed the "file is missing" icon.
   [+] Added right-click menu to the file list that allows the clearing of results, or ignoring of files during processing.
   [X] Some MD5Sum programs put an asterisk in front of the filename (indicating "binary" files). Adjusted the regex to handle that.
   [*] Hash Calculator report now distinguishes between text input and file input.
   [+] Hash Calculator now reports the number of bytes processed and approximate processing throughput speed.
   [*] The "Copy" action on the Hash Calculator results now copies the entire contents of the results if no text is selected.
   [+] Added a few shortcut keys for menu options.
   [+] Added a processing log. It can be viewed in the GUI and can be saved to a file. There is also a setting to automatically save a log upon processing a list.
   [+] Added a link to the MPL from the help menu.
